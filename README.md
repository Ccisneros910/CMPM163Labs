Cube Creation
  For the leftmost cube, I used the same method as the rightmost one, but changed the colors to create a more stark contrast between the colors. For the middle-top cube, I used a MeshFrameMaterial and set the wireframe to true, making the cube see-through. And the middle-bottom and rightmost cube were created following the lab instructions.
